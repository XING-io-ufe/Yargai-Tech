## 4. UX and Technical Requirements

This section expands UX/UI direction, a recommended visual system (dark theme), component guidance, and concrete 3D integration best practices so designers and engineers can implement consistent, accessible, performant experiences.

### Design principles

- Keep the interface minimalist and engineering-focused: clear hierarchy, generous spacing, restrained typography, and purposeful motion.
- Emphasize clarity and trust: metrics-first case studies, obvious CTAs, and consistent technical language.
- Progressive enhancement: advanced visuals (3D, animations) enhance — never replace — core content and actions.

### Visual system (recommended dark theme)

- Rationale: dark, near-black background creates a premium technical feel and highlights 3D models and accent colors.
- Core color tokens (CSS variables):
  - --bg-900: #08090A (page background)
  - --surface-800: #0F1113 (cards / surfaces)
  - --muted-700: #1F2933 (muted surfaces)
  - --text-100: #E6EEF8 (primary text)
  - --muted-text: #B6C2CF (secondary text)
  - --accent-500: #00BFA6 (primary accent - teal/cyan)
  - --accent-400: #7C3AED (optional secondary accent - purple)
  - --success: #22C55E, --warning: #F59E0B, --danger: #EF4444
- Use a restrained palette: one primary accent (teal) and one secondary (purple) for highlights, CTAs, and brand elements. Avoid saturated color backgrounds.

### Typography & spacing

- Type scale: base 16px; headings H1 48px, H2 32px, H3 24px, body 16px, small 14px. Use 1.25–1.6 line-height for body text.
- Recommended fonts: Inter (UI), JetBrains Mono for code blocks, with system fallbacks.
- Spacing: 8px baseline grid; use 16/24/32 spacing steps to maintain rhythm.

### UI patterns and components (must-have)

- Global: sticky header with compact nav, prominent contact CTA, dark-mode toggle (though default is dark).
- Hero: split layout — left: concise headline, subheadline, 2 CTAs; right: 3D canvas (desktop) or hero image fallback (mobile).
- Service cards: icon, 1-line summary, link to detail; hover elevation and subtle motion.
- Case study component: problem → solution → results (metric band), tech stack badges, architecture snapshot, PDF download, client quote.
- Portfolio gallery: filter chips (service/industry/tech), masonry cards, lightbox with gallery and metrics.
- Pricing: comparison table, included deliverables, timeline estimate, CTA.
- Blog post template: title, author, date, TOC, code block support, related posts, inline CTA.
- Contact: validated form, calendar booking link, alternate contact methods, clear post-submission state.
- Small components: badges, chips, tooltips, accessible modals, skeleton loaders, toast notifications.

### Motion & micro-interactions

- Use micro-interactions to clarify state: button presses, input validation, loading skeletons. Keep animations short (100–300ms) and meaningful.
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion: provide reduced/none motion variants.
- Use Framer Motion for UI transitions and minimal, tasteful entrance animations; avoid heavy looping animations that hurt CPU/GPU.

### 3D integration — design & implementation guidance

Purpose: add memorable, technical polish without hurting performance or accessibility.

Design rules

- Keep 3D scenes minimal and purposeful: single product/model or abstract technical visual per page (e.g., hero showcase, feature visual).
- Visual aesthetic: clean, low-to-medium polycount models, neutral base materials (desaturated greys/whites), one accent material using --accent-500, soft environment lighting, subtle rim-light for separation. Avoid noisy PBR textures unless necessary.
- Interaction: allow simple, discoverable interactions — rotate/zoom on mouse drag or touch pinch; show hint affordances (cursor, label).
- Fallbacks: always provide an optimized 2D image fallback (exported PNG/WebP/AVIF) for initial load or when WebGL is unavailable.

Technical best practices

- File formats & compression: GLB (glTF binary) as canonical format; apply Draco compression for geometry; KTX2/Basis Universal for textures to reduce download size.
- Tools/libraries: react-three-fiber (R3F) + @react-three/drei for primitives, useSuspense for assets, useGLTF for model loading. Consider model-viewer for very simple use-cases, but R3F gives more control.
- Lazy loading & code-splitting: dynamic import of 3D canvas with ssr: false in Next.js; render only on client. Use React.Suspense and placeholders/skeletons.
- LOD & mobile fallbacks: prepare multiple LODs or simplified impostor sprites; disable 3D on low-power devices or below a viewport width (e.g., < 768px) and serve optimized image.
- Performance tuning: bake lighting where possible, minimize lights & postprocessing, use baked AO/irradiance maps, avoid expensive postprocessing on mobile, merge meshes and use GPU instancing for repeated geometry.
- Rendering considerations: keep draw calls low, reuse materials, texture atlasing where applicable, prefer small texture sizes with compressed formats.
- Accessibility & controls: make non-essential 3D purely decorative (aria-hidden) or provide controls/readable captions for important content; ensure keyboard focus does not get trapped in canvas.

Example Next.js implementation notes

- Dynamic import:
  - const ModelHero = dynamic(() => import('components/ModelHero'), { ssr: false });
- Inside ModelHero use R3F Canvas with device pixel ratio clamp and frameloop='demand' when static: <Canvas frameloop="demand" dpr={[1, 1.5]} camera={{ fov: 35 }}>
- Preload and cache assets using useGLTF.preload and a CDN.

### Accessibility specifics for dark theme

- Maintain contrast: primary text on --bg-900 should be at least 7:1 for headings and 4.5:1 for body where possible; use --text-100 for main text and --muted-text for secondary.
- Focus states: high-visibility outlines (2px solid --accent-500 or 3px depending on component).
- Inputs & forms: labels always visible, error messages ARIA-live polite, success message announced.
- Color-only meaning: never rely on color alone — also use icons/text for status indicators.

### Performance & monitoring (practical rules)

- Critical: Home and primary Service pages must pass Lighthouse perf > 90 in staging before launch.
- Use responsive images (srcset + AVIF/WebP), lazy load offscreen images, preconnect critical origins, and use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 via CDN.
- Add RUM (Vercel / Datadog / Sentry) to monitor LCP and CLS in production and configure alerts for regressions.

### Component-level checklist for engineers

- Header: responsive menu, accessible keyboard nav, link focus states, contact CTA.
- Hero: text content, CTA, 3D canvas or image fallback, performance-safe implementation.
- Services list: card component, icon system, internal linking, schema markup for Service.
- Case study: header with metrics band, narrative sections (challenge/approach/results), gallery component, PDF download.
- Blog: structured article metadata, TOC, code block component with copy button, page-level schema.
- Forms: client-side validation, server-side validation, spam protection, and confirmation flow.

### Trade-offs & recommendations

- Avoid heavy 3D on entry pages for mobile and slower networks — prefer a high-quality image + light animation.
- Balance visuals with SEO: ensure important textual content is server-rendered and indexable; 3D must not hide critical copy.
- Start conservative: implement one or two high-quality 3D hero experiences first, measure performance and UX impact, then expand.
